## 📊 What This Prototype Demonstrates

### 1. **V2V-Enabled Vehicles**
- Receive real-time data from nearby vehicles
- Get AI-optimized speed recommendations
- Avoid collisions through predictive analysis
- Automatically yield to emergency vehicles
- Coordinate for smoother traffic flow

### 2. **Non-V2V Vehicles (Legacy)**
- Operate independently without vehicle coordination
- No collision warnings or avoidance
- Cannot detect emergency vehicles until very close
- Less efficient routing
- Higher accident risk

### 3. **Emergency Vehicles**
- Broadcast priority alerts
- V2V vehicles automatically clear path

- Demonstrates V2V safety advantage

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd "c:\Users\drvij\Desktop\MuLearn Scet\Microv2"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Start the Mother Server

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd backend/mother_server
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
🚦 V2V Traffic Management System - Mother Server
📡 Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 3: Start the Dashboard

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Step 4: Run the Vehicle Simulation

Open a **third terminal** and run:

```bash
cd vehicles
python vehicle_simulator.py
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Default Simulation
The simulation runs with:
- **8 V2V-enabled vehicles** (smart, coordinated)
- **8 Non-V2V vehicles** (legacy, uncoordinated)
- **2 Emergency vehicles** (V2V-enabled with priority)

### Customizing the Simulation

Edit `vehicles/vehicle_simulator.py` at the bottom:

```python
simulator = TrafficSimulator(
    num_v2v_vehicles=10,      # Change number of smart vehicles
    num_non_v2v_vehicles=5,   # Change number of legacy vehicles
    num_emergency=2            # Change number of emergency vehicles
)
```

### What to Watch For

1. **Emergency Vehicle Alerts**
   - V2V vehicles: Stop and yield immediately when emergency vehicle is 150m+ away
   - Non-V2V vehicles: No alert, potential conflicts

2. **Collision Avoidance**
   - V2V vehicles: Predictive braking, near-miss avoidance
   - Non-V2V vehicles: Reactive only, potential collisions

3. **Traffic Flow**
   - V2V vehicles: Coordinated speeds, smooth flow
   - Non-V2V vehicles: Independent speeds, stop-and-go

## 📺 Dashboard Features

## 🧪 Testing Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Emergency Response
```python
# High emergency vehicle density
simulator = TrafficSimulator(
    num_v2v_vehicles=15,
    num_non_v2v_vehicles=15,
    num_emergency=5  # More emergencies
)
```

**Expected Result:** V2V vehicles clear path, Non-V2V vehicles cause delays

### Scenario 2: Dense Traffic
```python
# High vehicle density
simulator = TrafficSimulator(
    num_v2v_vehicles=20,
    num_non_v2v_vehicles=5,
    num_emergency=1
)
```

**Expected Result:** V2V vehicles coordinate efficiently, maintain flow

### Scenario 3: Legacy Traffic
```python
# Mostly non-V2V vehicles
simulator = TrafficSimulator(
    num_v2v_vehicles=5,
    num_non_v2v_vehicles=20,
    num_emergency=2
)
```

**Expected Result:** More collisions, poor emergency response
